# 🏋️ FitZone Management System

This repository contains the code and resources for the **FitZone Management System**, a project designed to handle the core operations of a fitness center or gym. The system is built to manage everything from member logins and staff interfaces to data persistence using SQL.

---

## 🌟 Key Features

The project is structured to support different user roles and critical business functions:

### 👤 Role-Based Access
* **Secure Login:** Separate authentication processes for different user types.
* **User Interfaces:** Dedicated interfaces for management, staff, and potentially members.

### 💾 Data & Persistence
* **SQL Database Integration:** The system uses an external database, managed via the `fitzone.sql` file, for robust and structured data storage (Members, Staff, Schedules, etc.).
* **Image Management:** Includes a dedicated directory (`Images/`) for storing application assets like logos, training visuals, and interface backgrounds.

### ⚙️ Development Environment
* Includes Git configuration files (`.git/`) indicating this project is version-controlled via Git.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Resources

* **Primary Database:** SQL (schema provided in `fitzone.sql`)
* **Version Control:** Git
* **Assets:** Various image files (`.png`, `.jpeg`) for the application's visual design.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To set up and run this project locally, you will need:

1.  A compatible **IDE** (e.g., NetBeans, IntelliJ, VS Code) for the project's source code (not visible, but implied by project context).
2.  A **Database Management System** (DBMS) like MySQL or PostgreSQL.
3.  **Git** installed on your system.

### Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/udarajayasundara/FitZone.git](https://github.com/udarajayasundara/FitZone.git)
    cd FitZone
    ```

2.  **Initialize the Database:**
    * Open your DBMS client (e.g., MySQL Workbench, phpMyAdmin).
    * Create a new database (e.g., `fitzone_db`).
    * Import the schema and initial data using the provided SQL file:
        ```bash
        # Command line example (using MySQL)
        mysql -u [USERNAME] -p fitzone_db < fitzone.sql
        ```
3.  **Configure Connection:**
    * Locate the database connection settings within the project's source code (this is usually a configuration file or a `DBConnection.java`/`config.ini` file).
    * Update the connection details (username, password, and database name) to match your local DBMS setup.
4.  **Run the Application:**
    * Build and run the project from your IDE.
